# HomeWizard Energy

This app let's you connect your HomeWizard Energy to Homey. You can add your HomeWizard Energy in the device section.
Upon first deployment you need add the Homewizard unit first, then you can add the related/connected components from Homewizard to your Homey.

NOTE: As of verion 1.0.0 you must (re)pair your homewizard and other subcomponents (Energylink, Heatlink etc.) as they will fail due
to the big code change from SDKv1 to SDKv2.

v0.0.1
- First release

**If you like this app, then consider to buy me a beer :)**
